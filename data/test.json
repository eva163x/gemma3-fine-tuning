"question": "A plant is 10 cm tall. It grows 15% in one week. How tall is it after the growth?",
"reasoning": "1) Initial height = 10 cm.\n2) Growth = 15% of 10 = 0.15 × 10 = 1.5 cm.\n3) New height = 10 + 1.5 = 11.5 cm.",
"answer": "11.5 cm"

{
"question": "Which is larger: 7/8 or 3/4? By how much?",
"reasoning": "1) Convert to decimals or common denominator. 7/8 = 0.875, 3/4 = 0.75.\n2) Difference = 0.875 - 0.75 = 0.125 = 1/8.\n3) 7/8 is larger by 1/8.",

"question": "A ribbon is 2/3 meter long. If you cut it into pieces each 1/6 meter long, how many pieces do you get?",
"reasoning": "1) Length = 2/3 m. Piece length = 1/6 m.\n2) Number pieces = (2/3) ÷ (1/6) = (2/3) × 6 = 12/3 = 4.\n3) You get 4 pieces.",
