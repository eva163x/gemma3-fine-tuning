Using the double-angle formula, we have \\\\[\\n\\\\cot \\\\theta_{n+1} = \\\\cot( 2 \\\\theta_n ) = \\\\frac{\\\\cot^2 \\\\theta_n - 1}{2 \\\\cot \\\\theta_n}.\\n\\\\]It follows by induction that $x_n = \\\\cot \\\\theta_n$. Then, $P_0 = P_{2008}$ corresponds to $\\\\cot \\\\theta_0 = \\\\cot ( 2^{2008} \\\\theta_0 )$ (assuming that $P_0$ is never at the origin, or equivalently, $2^{n} \\\\theta$ is never an integer multiple of $\\\\pi$).\\n\\nSo, we need to find the number of $\\\\theta_0 \\\\in (0, \\\\pi)$ with the property that $2^{2008} \\\\theta_0 - \\\\theta_0 = k \\\\pi$ for some integer $k$. We have $\\\\theta_0 = \\\\frac{k \\\\pi}{2^{2008} - 1}$, so $k$ can be any integer between $1$ and $2^{2008}-2$ inclusive (and note that since the denominator is odd, the sequence never terminates). It follows that the number of starting positions is $\\\\boxed{2^{2008} -2}$.'}\n",
