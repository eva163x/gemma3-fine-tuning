Note that $$(x-m)(x-n) = x^2 - (m+n)x + mn = x^2 + ax + 5a,$$ and setting coefficients equal, it follows that  \\\\begin{align*}\\nm + n &= -a \\\\\\\\\\nmn &= 5a\\n\\\\end{align*} (This also follows directly from Vieta's formulas.) Notice that the $a$ can be canceled by either dividing or noting that $$0 = 5a + 5 \\\\cdot (-a) = mn + 5(m+n).$$\\n\\nSimon's Favorite Factoring Trick can now be applied: $$mn + 5m + 5n + 25 = (m+5)(n+5) = 25.$$ It follows that $m+5$ and $n+5$ are divisors of $25$, whose pairs of divisors are given by $\\\\pm \\\\{(1,25),(5,5),(25,1)\\\\}$. Solving, we see that $(m,n)$ is in the set $$\\\\{(-4,20),(0,0),(20,-4),(-6,-30),(-10,-10),(-30,-6)\\\\}.$$ However, the two pairs of symmetric solutions yield redundant values for $a$, so it follows that the answer is $\\\\boxed{4}$.\"}\n",

Given a point [MATH P_0 ] on the [MATH x ]-axis, we construct a sequence of points [MATH (P_n) ] on the [MATH x ]-axis in the following manner: let [MATH _n ] be the line with slope 1 passing passing through [MATH P_n ], then [MATH P_{n+1} ] is the orthogonal projection of the point of intersection of [MATH _n ] and [MATH C ] onto the [MATH x ]-axis. (If [MATH P_n = 0 ], then the sequence simply terminates.) Find the number of starting positions [MATH P_0 ] on the [MATH x ]-axis such that [MATH P_0 = P_{2008} ]. Your answer should use exponential notation, in simplest form.\n",

Since this point lies on the hyperbola, we have [MATH (x_{n+1} - x_n)^2 - x_{n+1}^2 = 1 ]. Rearranging this equation gives [MATH x_{n+1} = (x_n^2 - 1)/(2x_n). ]Choose a [MATH theta_0 (0, pi) ] with [MATH _0 = x_0 ], and define [MATH theta_n = 2^n theta_0 ]. Using the double-angle formula, we have [MATH theta_{n+1} = ( 2 theta_n ) = (^2 theta_n - 1)/(2 theta_n). ]It follows by induction that [MATH x_n = theta_n ]. Then, [MATH P_0 = P_{2008} ] corresponds to [MATH theta_0 = ( 2^{2008} theta_0 ) ] (assuming that [MATH P_0 ] is never at the origin, or equivalently, [MATH 2^{n} theta ] is never an integer multiple of [MATH pi ]). So, we need to find the number of [MATH theta_0 (0, pi) ] with the property that [MATH 2^{2008} theta_0 - theta_0 = k pi ] for some integer [MATH k ]. We have [MATH theta_0 = (k pi)/(2^{2008) - 1} ], so [MATH k ] can be any integer between [MATH 1 ] and [MATH 2^{2008}-2 ] inclusive (and note that since the denominator is odd, the sequence never terminates). It follows that the number of starting positions is [MATH 2^{2008 -2} ].\n",
